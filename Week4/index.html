                <p>I am Kerri Wilkinson, a strong, independent person who loves watching movies and food and naps during thunderstorms. I live in Barrington with my three children and my cat, Harvey. My kids are absolutely the most important thing in my life. They are my best friends and my closest family, and being a single mom to them is what drives me to continue to push myself  every day.</p><br>
        <p>My oldest daughter, Izzy, is 14. She loves to read, she's a talented artist, and she knows everything there is to know about animals. She is ridiculously smart, funny as heck, and she is such a good big sister.</p><br>
        <p>Henry, who is 8 years old, has so much charisma and charm. He makes friends everywhere he goes. He is naturally great at math and he is the most loving brother that any sibling could ask for.</p><br>
        <p>Ellie, who is 3 and a half, is the baby of the family. She is so full of joy and has the most amazing giggle you've ever heard. She is bubbly and fun and sassy, and she is full of character. She loves the water, music, dancing, painting, and her big brother and sister.</p><br>
        <p>After I finish school and become a software engineer, I am going to work from home and travel the world with my kids, get five more cats, and watch all the anime.</p>
