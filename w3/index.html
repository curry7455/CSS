      <h2>My Bio</h2>
      <p>I am <strong>Kerri Wilkinson</strong>, a strong, independent person who loves watching movies and food and naps during thunderstorms. I live in Barrington with my three children and my cat, Harvey.<em>Committment</em> is what drives me forward, and I always strive to be the best version of myself I can be. My kids are absolutely the most important thing in my life. </p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I grew up in Houston, Texas and went to public school there, but I attended my last year of high school at Smithfield High School in Rhode Island. After a few years I attended Quincy College for Licensed Practical Nursing. I was a nurse for several years when I started studying Business Management at Massasoit Community College in Brockton, MA. I was almost done with my degree when I found out I was expecting my son, so I took a break from school again.  </p>

    <div id="hobbies" class="section hide">
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>Most of my free time is spent either doing homework or hanging out with my three kids. They are my best friends. When I want to unwind, you can often find me cleaning up after one of the many living things in my apartment, studying, or watching some movie.</p>
